The process
Complete the following steps:

Open your command line or terminal
cd to your thinkful projects directory
Run npx create-react-app react-playground to create a new folder called react-playground with a React app inside
cd ./react-playground to go into the new directory
Run npm install to install all the dependencies we need
Run the following commands to remove the following files from this directory:
rm ./src/serviceWorker.js
rm ./src/App.css
rm ./src/logo.svg
Update the content of ./src/App.js and ./src/index.js as follows to create a minimal starting point for the application

Copy and paste the below code into ./src/App.js replacing what was already there (we'll explain it shortly).

import React from 'react';

function App() {
  return (
    <main className='App'>
      {/* content goes here */}
    </main>
  );
}

export default App;
Now replace the content of ./src/index.js with the following code:

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './App';
import './index.css';

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
